# MQTT Processing Template
A base sketch for building networked Processing projects with MQTT

Based on the example in Tingenek's post [MQTT with Processing](https://tingenek.wordpress.com/2012/12/31/mqtt-with-processing/)

## Tested on:
* [Processing 2.0.3](https://processing.org/download/?processing)

## Requirements
* [WMQTT library from IBM](http://www14.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/weblap/lap.pl?popup=Y&li_formnum=L-TMAN-5N7JL9&accepted_url=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/integration/support/supportpacs/individual/ia92.zip) - Copy the file ia92/J2SE/wmqtt.jar to ~/Documents/Processing/libraries/wmqtt/library/

## TODO
* Switch to the Eclipse Paho Java libraries
* Tidy up and refactor code
